# Cursor Design Academy - Project Rules

## Project Context
This is an educational web application designed to teach product designers how to use Cursor.
The target audience is designers with little to no coding experience.

## Tech Stack
- React 18.2 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Lucide React for icons
- Framer Motion for animations

## Design System

### Colors
- Primary: #0ea5e9 (blue)
- Primary Dark: #0284c7
- Accent: #d946ef (purple)
- Accent Dark: #c026d3
- Success: #10b981 (green)
- Warning: #f59e0b (yellow)
- Error: #ef4444 (red)

### Spacing
Based on 8px unit:
- xs: 4px
- sm: 8px
- md: 16px
- lg: 24px
- xl: 32px
- 2xl: 48px

### Typography
- Headings: Bold, gradient colors
- Body: Regular weight, 16px base
- Use Inter or system fonts

### Components
- Cards: white bg, rounded-xl, shadow-lg, p-6
- Buttons: gradient backgrounds, hover effects, rounded-lg
- Badges: rounded-full, small text
- Progress bars: h-2, gradient fill

## Code Style

### React Components
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Props interfaces above component
- Descriptive prop names
- Export as default at bottom

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (UserCard.tsx)
- Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- CSS classes: Tailwind utility classes
- Functions: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### File Organization
```
/src
  /components  - Reusable UI components
  /pages       - Route pages
  /contexts    - React contexts
  /utils       - Helper functions (if needed)
```

### Styling
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes
- Use custom CSS only when necessary
- Responsive: mobile-first approach
- Animations: subtle and purposeful

## AI Instructions

When helping with this project:
1. Keep explanations simple and educational
2. Always consider responsive design
3. Follow accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
4. Use TypeScript for type safety
5. Comment complex logic
6. Suggest improvements when relevant
7. Be encouraging - this is a learning project!

## Best Practices
- Every component should work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Use semantic HTML (button, nav, header, etc.)
- Add hover and focus states for interactive elements
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic
- Test as you build

## Don'ts
- Don't use external libraries without discussion
- Don't overcomplicate - keep it simple
- Don't skip accessibility features
- Don't use inline styles
- Don't create God components (too many responsibilities)

## Testing
When adding new features:
1. Test on different screen sizes
2. Check keyboard navigation
3. Verify color contrast
4. Test with screen reader (if possible)
5. Check browser console for errors
